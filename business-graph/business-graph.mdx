By defining Business Objects, you've already established a strong foundation of data context. The Business Graph™ is used to map additional context to the data, enhancing the relevancy of Push.ai's AI systems. Over time, we'll expand functionality to include and integrate additional sources of business context. Below is a list of the capabilities available today.

## Metric Relationships

<Check>
  Metric Relationships are available on the [Starter and Enterprise
  Plan](https://www.push.ai/pricing).
</Check>

Define relationships between metrics to include additional context and leverage additional analaysis capabilities. Metric relationships are defined through input and output metrics, in what is commonly known as a metric tree.

## Metadata for Business Objects

Attach metdata to Business Objects, like metrics and dimensions. For metrics and dimensions defined in Push.ai, you can use descriptions to attach metadata. Semantic layer integrations may offer additional metadata capabilities that can be integrated with Push.ai.

## Goals

<Note>
  **Note:** If you'd like to input a large list of goals or would like to define
  goals at the dimension level, you can [reach out to
  us](mailto:support@push.ai) and someone from our team can help you get set up.
</Note>

Define goals to keep teams accountable and identify where teams are on or off track. Goals can be defined on metrics at a monthly time grain in the UI.

## Metric-Dimension Relationships

<Note>
  **Example:** If a user is Subscribed to a metric such as Revenue,
  Metric-Dimension relationships allow our systems to pull in related context,
  like the Dimensions we can use to slice Revenue (e.g., Revenue by Product,
  Revenue by Country, etc.)
</Note>

Metric-Dimension relationships are generated as a result of defining Business Objects like metrics and dimensions. They serve a crucial role in the Business Graph™, allowing our systems to pull in context from related Business Objects.

## Organizational Context

Organizational context is an open text field that can be configured in [Organization Settings](https://app.push.ai/settings). This allows you to add additional context around your organization that can be used to enhance the relevancy of Push.ai's AI systems.
