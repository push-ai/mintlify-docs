The Business Graph™ is a graph-based representation of your business that integrates
data with business context. You can think of the Business Graph™ as a model of your
business which encompasses:

- the data and measurement system used to measure success
- the people in the business and their individual roles in driving success
- the projects and goals that the business is working to achieve

## Data Context

The Business Graph™ allows you to model your data beyond tables and columns. Through centrally defined metrics and dimensions, you can explicitly define a measurement system for sucess.

For example, by defining metric-relationships and dimension-relationships, you gain visibility into how different parts of the business relate to each other.

## Business Context

The Business Graph™ increases the knowledge of your organization by capturing and organizing information outside your measurement system. Conversations, documents and other sources of unstructured data can be mapped back to the individual Business Objects in your Business Graph™. This is valuable in two major ways:

- improves the ability for organizations to share information and collaborate around the correct actions
- improves the relevancy of AI systems using context not available in the data directly

For example, a marketing team might be discussing a spike in performance and determine that the increase was due to a cultural holiday within a specific region. This information, whether it be in a Slack message, weekly business review, or logged in Push.ai can be mapped back to the Business Object for that region and referenced by others exploring that same region and in AI systems.
