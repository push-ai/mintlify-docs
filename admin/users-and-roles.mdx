## Adding Users

Users can be added to your organization through an invitation flow or automatically according to their email domain. All users' email addresses are verified during user creation.

### Automatic Assignment

Any user who signs up with an email domain that matches the organization's domain will be automatically added to their organization. Common domains such as gmail, hotmail, etc. are excluded from this policy.

### Invitation

Any user who is invited via an invite flow will be added to the organization regardless of their email domain. This allows you to include team members or external collaborators who may not share your organization's email domain.
