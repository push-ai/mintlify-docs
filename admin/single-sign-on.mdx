# Single Sign-On Integration

Push.ai supports using Identity Providers (IdP) such as Okta to control authentication through single sign-on (SSO). We also support provisioning and deprovisioning Push.ai users along with managing their role assignments through SCIM (directory sync).

## Setting up SSO

Push.ai supports the SAML protocol for single sign-on authentication. To initiate setup, contact our support team at support@push.ai. We'll provide specific instructions and a test environment for setting up Push.ai with your preferred IdP.

### Post-Integration Changes

After completing the SSO integration:

- Users will no longer be able to log in with their previous Push.ai authentication method (username & password or Google)
- Attempting to use previous authentication methods will redirect users to the SSO login page
- Users will need to input their email, which will use the domain to redirect to your IdP for sign-in
- Users can log in directly from your IdP by clicking on the Push.ai application integration

<Warning>
**Email Requirements**

The primary email of each user assigned to Push.ai in your IdP must match their Push.ai user's email. Otherwise, they won't be able to log in to their Push.ai account.

</Warning>

## SCIM Configuration

### Overview

SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) enables you to:

- Create and delete Push.ai users directly within your IdP
- Update user information (including email)
- Manage Push.ai role assignments

### Required Attributes

In addition to standard attributes (`id`, `emails`, `first_name`, `last_name`), Push.ai requires the following custom attribute:

`roles` â†’ `<name_of_push_ai_role_1>`
Examples: `Admin`, `Data`, or `NormalUser`

<Note>
  **Important Notes about Roles** - Role assignments must be non-empty -
  SCIM-enabled organizations do not have default roles - All role assignments
  must be explicitly managed through your IdP - Role names are case-insensitive
</Note>

### Initial Synchronization

During initial SCIM setup:

1. We match IdP users with existing Push.ai users by primary email
2. Matched users will be linked to their IdP identity
3. Future updates (including email changes) will sync automatically
4. New IdP users without matching Push.ai accounts will have accounts provisioned automatically

### User Management

- User assignments in your IdP automatically sync to Push.ai in real-time
- Creating, editing, and deleting users must be done through your IdP
- Direct user management in Push.ai is restricted for SSO-enabled organizations

### Role Management

- Creating and editing roles must still be done within Push.ai by Admins
- Role assignments to users must be managed in your IdP using the `roles` attribute
- Available roles include: Admin, Data, and Normal User
