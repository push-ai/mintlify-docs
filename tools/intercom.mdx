<Accordion title="Scroll over all companies">
The `list all companies` functionality does not work well for huge datasets, and can result in errors and performance problems when paging deeply. the scroll api provides an efficient mechanism for iterating over all companies in a dataset. - each app can only have 1 scroll open at a time. you'll get an error message if you try to have more than one open per app. you can get the first page of companies by simply sending a get request to the scroll endpoint. for subsequent requests you will need to use the scroll parameter from the response type="danger" name="scroll network timeouts". since scroll is often used on large datasets network errors such as timeouts can be encountered. when this occurs you will see a http 500 error with the following message: "request failed due to an internal network error. please restart the scroll operation." if this happens, you will need to restart your scroll query.
