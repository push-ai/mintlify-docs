<Accordion title="Fetch typescript project info">
Retrieves typescript type definitions generated from the database schema of a specified supabase project. this endpoint is essential for developers working with typescript in their supabase projects, as it provides type-safe access to database tables and views. the generated types enhance code quality by enabling compile-time checks and autocompletion in ides. use this endpoint when setting up a new typescript project with supabase or after making changes to your database schema to ensure your types are up-to-date. note that this endpoint does not modify your database or project settings; it only retrieves the current type definitions based on your existing schema.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create a database branch">
Creates a database branch from the specified project.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reverify custom hostname by project id">
Re-verifies the custom hostname associated with a specific supabase project. this endpoint is used when there's a need to confirm or update the verification status of a previously set custom hostname for a project. it should be called after making changes to dns settings, updating ssl certificates, or when troubleshooting domain-related issues. the re-verification process ensures that the custom hostname is correctly configured and accessible. this tool is particularly useful for maintaining the proper functioning of custom domains in supabase projects, especially after domain configuration changes or when addressing connectivity problems.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Retrieve project secret by ref">
Retrieves all secrets associated with a specific supabase project. this endpoint is used to fetch sensitive information such as api keys, tokens, or other confidential data that are crucial for the project's functionality but need to be kept secure. it should be used when you need to access or manage the secrets for a particular project, for example, during development, debugging, or when rotating credentials. the endpoint returns a list of secret objects, likely including details such as secret names, values (possibly masked), and any associated metadata. be cautious when using this endpoint, as it exposes sensitive information. ensure proper authentication and authorization measures are in place to protect the returned data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="List all database branches">
Returns all database branches of the specified project.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Retrieve snippets list">
Retrieves a collection of code snippets from the supabase backend. this endpoint allows developers to fetch pre-defined code fragments or templates that can be used in their supabase applications. it's particularly useful for accessing commonly used database queries, functions, or other reusable code components. the endpoint returns all available snippets or a filtered set based on default criteria. use this when you need to quickly access and integrate pre-written code into your supabase project, improving development efficiency and maintaining consistency across your application. note that this endpoint does not provide functionality for creating, updating, or deleting snippets.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Delete sso provider">
Deletes a specific single sign-on (sso) provider configuration from a supabase project. this endpoint is used to remove an sso provider's settings when you no longer want to offer that authentication method for your application. it's particularly useful when updating your authentication strategy or removing unused sso options. be cautious when using this endpoint, as it will immediately disable the specified sso provider for all users, potentially affecting their ability to log in if they primarily use that method.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="List project functions endpoint">
Retrieves a list of edge functions associated with a specific supabase project. this endpoint allows developers to fetch all deployed functions within a project, enabling them to manage and monitor their serverless functions. use this endpoint when you need to review, audit, or programmatically interact with the functions in your supabase project. it provides an overview of the available functions but does not return the function code or execution details. this tool is particularly useful for devops tasks, ci/cd pipelines, or building custom management interfaces for supabase projects.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create organization">
Creates a new organization within supabase. this endpoint is used to establish a top-level entity that can manage multiple projects, handle access control, and centralize billing. organizations in supabase provide a way to group related projects and collaborate with team members efficiently. use this endpoint when setting up a new team, company, or project group in supabase. it's an essential first step for teams or companies that plan to work on multiple projects or need to manage access for various team members across different projects.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create new project">
Creates a new supabase project with specified configurations. this endpoint allows you to set up a new project within your organization, configuring essential parameters such as database credentials, project name, hosting region, and instance size. it's used when initializing a new supabase environment for your application. the endpoint handles the provisioning of necessary resources and sets up the project according to your specifications. note that some parameters like subscription plans are now managed at the organization level and are not part of this project creation process.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="List organization members by slug">
Retrieves a list of members for a specified organization within supabase. this endpoint is used to fetch details about users who are part of the organization, which is crucial for managing access control, permissions, and team collaboration. the endpoint returns information such as user ids, roles, and potentially other relevant details about each member. it should be used when you need to audit organization membership, manage team access, or display a roster of organization members. note that this endpoint only provides member information and does not allow for adding, removing, or modifying member details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reset branch by id">
The resetbranch endpoint is used to reset a specific branch in supabase to a clean state. this operation reverts the database schema and data of the specified branch to its initial state, effectively undoing all changes made since the branch was created or last reset. it's particularly useful during development and testing phases when you need to start fresh or revert unwanted changes. the endpoint should be used cautiously as it will permanently delete all data and schema changes in the branch. it's recommended to use this endpoint only in non-production environments or when you're absolutely certain about resetting the branch. note that this operation cannot be undone, so it's crucial to have proper backups or snapshots before performing a reset.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Delete project by ref">
Deletes a specific supabase project identified by its unique reference. this endpoint should be used when you want to permanently remove a project from your supabase account, including all its associated resources such as databases, authentication settings, and storage. it's important to note that this action is irreversible and will result in the loss of all data and configurations associated with the project. use this endpoint with caution, typically when a project is no longer needed or when cleaning up development or test environments. it does not provide any option for data backup before deletion, so ensure you have made necessary backups if required before calling this endpoint.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create sso provider configuration">
Creates a new single sign-on (sso) provider for a supabase project, specifically for saml 2.0 authentication. this endpoint allows you to configure and integrate an external identity provider with your supabase authentication system, enabling users to log in using their organizational credentials. use this when setting up enterprise-level authentication or when you need to support federated identity management. the endpoint requires detailed configuration of the saml provider, including metadata and attribute mapping, to ensure proper integration and user attribute synchronization.
