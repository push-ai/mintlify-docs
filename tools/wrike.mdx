</Accordion>

<Accordion title="List subfolders by folder id">
Retrieves a list of subfolders within a specified parent folder in the wrike workspace. this endpoint is used to navigate the folder hierarchy and obtain information about the immediate child folders of a given folder. it's particularly useful for building folder tree structures, implementing folder navigation in user interfaces, or when you need to process or analyze the contents of a specific folder. the endpoint returns only the direct subfolders and does not recursively fetch nested folder structures. use this when you need to explore or manage the organization of projects, tasks, or other items within the wrike folder system. note that this endpoint does not provide information about the contents of the subfolders (such as tasks or files) - it only returns folder metadata.

This endpoint permanently deletes a specific custom field from the wrike system. it should be used when you need to remove a custom field that is no longer required or relevant to your project management workflow. the deletion is irreversible, so use this endpoint with caution. only account administrators or users with appropriate permissions can perform this operation. after deletion, the custom field will no longer be available for tasks, folders, projects, or spaces where it was previously used. this endpoint does not return the deleted field's data; it typically returns a success status upon completion. be aware that deleting a custom field may affect existing reports or integrations that rely on that field's data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Update contact details by id">
The updatecontactdetails endpoint allows you to modify various aspects of a contact's information in wrike. this put request to /contacts/\{contactid\} enables updating metadata, bill rates, cost rates, job roles, and custom fields for a specific contact. use this endpoint when you need to change or add details to a contact's profile, such as updating their job role, modifying billing information, or managing custom fields. the endpoint provides granular control over which fields to update and allows for the inclusion of specific fields in the response. note that while users have full read/write access to their own metadata, they may have limited access to other contacts' information. additionally, custom fields can be removed by setting their values to null, providing flexibility in managing contact data.
</Accordion>

Deletes a specified folder from the wrike workspace. this endpoint permanently removes the folder and all its contents, including tasks, documents, and subfolders. use this endpoint when you need to eliminate a project or organizational structure that is no longer needed. exercise caution when calling this endpoint, as the deletion is irreversible and may affect team members' access to information. the operation may fail if the folder contains active tasks or if the user doesn't have sufficient permissions to delete the folder. it's recommended to review the folder contents and inform team members before deletion.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Delete group by id">
Deletes a specific group from the wrike workspace. this endpoint should be used when you need to remove a group that is no longer required, such as for organizational restructuring or cleaning up obsolete team structures. it permanently removes the group and its associations, but does not affect the users who were members of the group. use with caution as this action cannot be undone. the endpoint does not return the deleted group's data; it typically returns a success status code upon completion.
