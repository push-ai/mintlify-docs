<Accordion title="View organization notification actions">
Returns all spike protection notification actions for an organization. notification actions notify a set of members when an action has been triggered through a notification service such as slack or sentry. for example, organization owners and managers can receive an email when a spike occurs. you can use either the `project` or `projectslug` query parameter to filter for certain projects. note that if both are present, `projectslug` takes priority.
