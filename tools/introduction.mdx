## Providers

Providers are third party applications that support various tools. Users and organizations access tools by authenticating with these providers, typically through OAuth or API keys.

User authentication allows individuals to connect their personal accounts, enabling access to user-specific resources and actions. Organization-level authentication, on the other hand, grants access to shared resources and enables broader context gathering across the entire organization. 

## Using Tools

After a provider is integrated, the Query Agent will have access to a list of "tools." Tools serve a variety of purposes:

- Used within Push.ai managed tools (e.g., search API's are often abstracted into our "Search Knowledge" tool)
- Gather context when answering queries
- Perform actions, both entirely agent-driven and human-in-the-loop

## Security and Access controls

- Providers often have both user-level and organization level authentication methods and tools
- User-level tools are often tied to action-driven tools like creating and updating provider specific resources (e.g., send a Slack message)
- Organization-level tools support context gathering across the entire organization (e.g., list all Github issues)

## Custom Tools and API Integrations
