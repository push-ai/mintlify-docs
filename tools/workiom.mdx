Workiom provides APIs for automating workflows, integrating with
    various tools, and building custom applications.

<Accordion title="Create record">
Creates a new record in a specified workiom list. this tool creates a record with basic field types like text, numbers, dates, and static list items. the record data should be provided as a json object where each key is a field id and the value matches the expected data type for that field.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Get all lists">
Get all lists from a workiom workspace. this action fetches all available lists in a workiom workspace. it's a fundamental tool that serves as a prerequisite for most other operations (like creating records, which require a list id). the action supports pagination and can optionally include field definitions for each list.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Get records">
