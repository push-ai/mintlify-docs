Search Slack messages, private and public channels for important business context on any Query

<Accordion title="Search messages endpoint">
The search.messages endpoint allows you to search for messages across all channels, direct messages, and private groups in a slack workspace. it provides powerful search capabilities to find specific content within conversations. this endpoint is particularly useful for retrieving historical information, locating important discussions, or building search functionality into slack-integrated applications. the search results include message content, associated metadata, and can be refined using various parameters for sorting, highlighting, and pagination. keep in mind that the search may not include very recent messages due to indexing delays, and there may be rate limits on the number of requests you can make in a given time period.

<Accordion title="List users">
The 'users.list' endpoint retrieves a comprehensive list of users within a slack workspace. it provides detailed information about each user, including their profile data, account settings, and team memberships. this endpoint is particularly useful for applications that need to synchronize user data, manage user permissions, or perform bulk operations on user accounts. the response includes both active and deactivated users, allowing for a complete overview of the workspace's user base. however, it's important to note that the endpoint may not return real-time data, and there might be a slight delay in reflecting recent changes to user accounts.
