<Accordion title="Add a reaction to a comment">

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create a webhook">
Create a new webhook which will call the specified endpoint when the event triggers. by default, this webhook will automatically send a ping event to the endpoint when it is created. if this behavior is not desired, you can create the webhook and set the status to paused and reactivate it later.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create modify delete variables">
This endpoint allows you to manage variables, variable collections, modes, and their values within a figma file. it provides comprehensive control over your design system's variable structure, enabling you to create, update, and delete variable collections, modes, and individual variables. you can also set specific values for variables across different modes. use this endpoint when you need to programmatically update your design system's variable structure or values, such as during bulk updates or when synchronizing with external systems. the endpoint supports various variable types (boolean, float, string, color) and allows for platform-specific code syntax definitions. keep in mind that this endpoint performs multiple actions in a single call, so careful structuring of your request is essential to avoid unintended changes.

<Accordion title="Create dev resources">
Bulk create dev resources across multiple files. dev resources that are successfully created will show up in the links created array in the response. if there are any dev resources that cannot be created, you may still get a 200 response. these resources will show up in the errors array. some reasons a dev resource cannot be created include: - resource points to a `file key` that cannot be found. - the node already has the maximum of 10 dev resources. - another dev resource for the node has the same url.

<Accordion title="Get payments">
There are two methods to query for a user's payment information on a plugin, widget, or community file. the first method, using plugin payment tokens, is typically used when making queries from a plugin's or widget's code. the second method, providing a user id and resource id, is typically used when making queries from anywhere else. note that you can only query for resources that you own. in most cases, this means that you can only query resources that you originally created.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Get library analytics variable action data">
Returns a list of library analytics variable actions data broken down by the requested dimension.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Get image fills">
Returns download links for all images present in image fills in a document. image fills are how figma represents any user supplied images. when you drag an image into figma, we create a rectangle with a single fill that represents the image, and the user is able to transform the rectangle (and properties on the fill) as they wish. this endpoint returns a mapping from image references to the urls at which the images may be download. image urls will expire after no more than 14 days. image references are located in the output of the get files endpoint under the `imageref` attribute in a `paint`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Get projects in a team">
You can use this endpoint to get a list of all the projects within the specified team. this will only return projects visible to the authenticated user or owner of the developer token. note: it is not currently possible to programmatically obtain the team id of a user just from a token. to obtain a team id, navigate to a team page of a team you are a part of. the team id will be present in the url after the word team and before your team name.

<Accordion title="Get file json for specific nodes">
Retrieves nodes (design elements) from a specified figma file. this endpoint allows developers to access and extract various design components, such as shapes, text layers, frames, components, and groups, from a particular figma document. it's particularly useful for applications that need to analyze, render, or manipulate figma designs programmatically. the endpoint should be used when you need to fetch the structure and content of a figma file, but it won't provide real-time collaborative features or make changes to the file. keep in mind that the response may be large for complex files with many nodes, so consider performance implications when making frequent calls.

<Accordion title="Get activity logs">
Returns a list of activity log events
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Get local variables">
**this api is available to full members of enterprise orgs.** the `get /v1/files/:file key/variables/local` endpoint lets you enumerate local variables created in the file and remote variables used in the file. remote variables are referenced by their `subscribed id`. as a part of the variables related api additions, the `get /v1/files/:file key` endpoint now returns a `boundvariables` property, containing the `variableid` of the bound variable. the `get /v1/files/:file key/variables/local` endpoint can be used to get the full variable or variable collection object. note that `get /v1/files/:file key/variables/published` does not return modes. instead, you will need to use the `get /v1/files/:file key/variables/local` endpoint, in the same file, to examine the mode values.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Get published variables">
**this api is available to full members of enterprise orgs.** the `get /v1/files/:file key/variables/published` endpoint returns the variables that are published from the given file. the response for this endpoint contains some key differences compared to the `get /v1/files/:file key/variables/local` endpoint: - each variable and variable collection contains a `subscribed id`. - modes are omitted for published variable collections published variables have two ids: an id that is assigned in the file where it is created (`id`), and an id that is used by subscribing files (`subscribed id`). the `id` and `key` are stable over the lifetime of the variable. the `subscribed id` changes every time the variable is modified and published. the same is true for variable collections. the `updatedat` fields are iso 8601 timestamps that indicate the last time that a change to a variable was published. for variable collections, this timestamp will change any time a variable in the collection is changed.

<Accordion title="Render images of file nodes">
Renders images from a file. if no error occurs, `"images"` will be populated with a map from node ids to urls of the rendered images, and `"status"` will be omitted. the image assets will expire after 30 days. images up to 32 megapixels can be exported. any images that are larger will be scaled down. important: the image map may contain values that are `null`. this indicates that rendering of that specific node has failed. this may be due to the node id not existing, or other reasons such has the node having no renderable components. it is guaranteed that any node that was requested for rendering will be represented in this map whether or not the render succeeded. to render multiple images from the same file, use the `ids` query parameter to specify multiple node ids. ``` get /v1/images/:key?ids=1:2,1:3,1:4 ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Update dev resources">
Bulk update dev resources across multiple files. ids for dev resources that are successfully updated will show up in the `links updated` array in the response. if there are any dev resources that cannot be updated, you may still get a 200 response. these resources will show up in the `errors` array.
</Accordion>
