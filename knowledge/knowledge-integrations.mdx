## Warehouse Integrations

Warehouse integrations provide a powerful way to process and analyze unstructured data stored in your data warehouse:

- **Native Source Support**: Process data from various sources (Slack, Notion, etc.) directly from your warehouse
- **Source-Specific Processing**: Each source type (e.g., Slack messages, Notion pages) has its own optimized processing pipeline
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintain source-specific metadata and context throughout the processing pipeline
- **dbt Package Support**: Leverage dbt packages to transform and prepare unstructured data for processing

## API Integrations

API integrations enable real-time processing of unstructured data from various sources:

- **Direct Source Connections**: Connect to sources like Slack, Notion, and other platforms via their APIs
- **Real-time Processing**: Process and analyze content as it's created or updated
- **Source-Specific Chunking**: Apply optimized chunking strategies based on the source type
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Automatically enrich content with source-specific metadata

## File Uploads

File uploads provide a flexible way to process individual documents and content:

- **Direct Processing**: Upload and process individual files or batches of files
- **Document Intelligence**: Extract insights from various document types (PDFs, Word docs, etc.)

## Artifact-Specific Processing

Push.ai applies artifact-specific processing and chunking techniques:

- **Message Processing**: Process chat messages with channel-level artifact grouping
- **Document Processing**: Handle documents as single artifacts with recursive LLM-based chunking
- **Source-Agnostic Analysis**: Apply consistent analysis techniques across different sources
- **Context and Metadata Preservation**: Maintain relationships and metadata across artifacts and source context
