The Knowledge system in Push.ai processes unstructured data through a pipeline that transforms raw content into a repository of context built around the structured model of your business.

  Knowledge is currently only available on the [Enterprise
  Plan](https://www.push.ai/pricing).

## Artifacts

Artifacts are one of the foundational elements of the knowledge system, representing a piece of unstructured content, like a document, meeting, or Slack channel. Learn more about artifacts and their categories in our [Artifacts documentation](/business-objects/artifacts).

## Chunks

Chunks are the atomic building blocks of knowledge processing. We use artifact-specific chunking techniques to break down artifacts into meaningful segments while preserving their original context and structure. This approach enables:

- **Semantic Search**: Breaking content into appropriately sized chunks allows for more precise and relevant search results
- **Context Preservation**: Each chunk maintains its relationship to the original artifact and its position within the larger document
- **Citation Support**: The chunking process preserves metadata and structural information needed for accurate citations

## Vector Embeddings and Inference

Once content is chunked, we use vector embeddings to transform text into numerical representations that capture semantic meaning. This enables:

- **Semantic Search**: Finding relevant content based on meaning rather than just keywords
- **Context Mapping**: Automatically connecting unstructured content to relevant business objects
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying relationships and patterns across different pieces of content

## Business Graph Integration

The processed knowledge is then integrated with your Business Graph™ through:

- **Automatic Tagging**: Content is automatically tagged with relevant business objects
- **Context Enrichment**: Unstructured insights are used to enhance the context of structured data
- **Relationship Mapping**: New relationships between business objects are discovered and mapped
