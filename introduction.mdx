## What is Push.ai?

Push.ai is a business intelligence platform that enables teams to answer any business question.

Push.ai works by first defining a model of your business, using a set of metrics, dimensions, entities and other metadata. After this model is in place, connect with more than 250\+ third party applications, to integrate the contextual information of your business through sources of unstructured data. Combining individual pieces from the structured data model and measurement system, with related context is the core mechanism behind the platform and a system we refer to as the Business Graph. 

With the Business Graph, users can quickly get answers to business questions, and receive AI-generated updates or analysis that increase organizational knowledge and drive action.
