## What is Push.ai?

Push.ai is a business observability tool that helps every employee stay up-to-date with what's important.

Push.ai works by connecting with a datasource, defining a set of metrics specific to your business, and then performs automated data analysis to proactively deliver updates that make data analysis more accessible to anyone.

Users can receive updates through Reports and Subscriptions, which deliver metrics and AI-generated analysis in communication channels like Slack, email, and Microsoft Teams.
