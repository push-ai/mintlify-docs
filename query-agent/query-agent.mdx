## Features

- Ask questions in natural language using trusted semantic-layer queries
- Agentic Business Graph exploration (i.e., it can do data analysis for you)
- Support for citations, sources, charts, tables
- Share conversations across your team

## Tagging Business Objects

Objects can be explicity tagged an brought into context by typing "@". The agent will also search for objects relevant to the user's query, so tagging is recommended but not required.

## Exploratory Data analysis

The agent performs well when tasked with questions that require exploratory dat analysis. As an example, when asking "why" a metric has changed, the agent will navigate the Business Graph™ by pulling the data by relevant dimensions to look for specific drivers or time periods of the change.

## Web Search

The agent can retrieve real-time web data to help augment an analysis and provide import context. For example, for a seasonal or weather related business, we can retrieve real-time and historical weather data to understand it's affects on business metrics.

## Sharing

Conversations with the Query Agent can be shared using a URL. Viewing shared conversations requires a user login.
