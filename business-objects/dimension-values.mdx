## How Dimension Values work in Push.ai?

In Push.ai, Dimension Values are first-class citizens that get automatically generated, rather than being defined by the admin or user. Using <Tooltip tip="The search bar at the top of the application">omni-search</Tooltip>, you can quickly find any Dimension Value and explore all of its related metrics. This is especially valuable for data teams because it allows business users to access data and metrics specific to their area of the business without relying on a data team to build out custom views.
