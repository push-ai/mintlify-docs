## Features

- Define dimensions centrally and use them across multiple metrics.
- Enabled AI for dimensions that are the primary drivers of your metrics.
- Define hierarchies across dimensions to add additional context to your data. _(coming soon)_.

## âœ¨ AI Enabled Dimensions

This feature enables Dimensions for use in AI systems. We recommend enabling this for any Dimensions considered to be the primary drivers of metric changes. These are often lower cardinality dimensions, such as Marketing Channel, Country or Product.

<Warning>
  Selecting this feature across too many dimensions or high cardinality
  dimensions can result in noise in AI features and create unnecessary compute
  on your datasource.
</Warning>
