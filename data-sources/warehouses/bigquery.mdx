# BigQuery

Follow our setup guide to connect your BigQuery data warehouse to Push.ai.

### Prerequisites

To connect BigQuery to Push.ai, you need the following:

- The ability to create service accounts in Google Cloud Console.

### Step 1 -  Create a service account in the cloud console

- [Link to create service account.](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create?pli=1)

<img
  src={require('/static/img/bigquery-create-service-account.png').default}
  alt="Create service account"
  py="6"
/>

### Step 2 - Grant permissions

- Select and grant the ``BigQuery Data Viewer`` and ``BigQuery User`` roles

<img
  src={require('/static/img/bigquery-grant-viewer-user-permission.png').default}
  alt="Add Bigquery Admin permissions"
  py="6"
/>

### Step 3 - Create a key and download the file 

<img
  src={require('/static/img/bigquery-manage-keys.png').default}
  alt="Manage keys"
  py="6"
/>

### Step 4 - Whitelist IP Addresses (if necessary)

Push.ai connects to your warehouse from the following IP addresses. Be sure to allow traffic from these IPs in your firewall, and include them in any database grants.


| Region/Deployment | IP Addresses  |
|-------------------|---------------|
| All               | ```44.226.145.213```, ```54.187.200.255```, ```34.213.214.55```, ```35.164.95.156```, ```44.230.95.183```, ```44.229.200.200```|

### Step 5 - Configure the connection in Push.ai

- Copy the ```project_id``` from URL
- Upload the JSON key file


### Enhanced Security Controls
