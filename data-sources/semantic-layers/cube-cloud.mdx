## Usage Notes

After connecting with Cube, measures and dimensions need to be converted into metrics. This can be done in two ways:

1. Measures and dimensions will automatically be available in the Report builder and can be converted to metrics in the Data section of the Report builder. Any metrics configured here will be created and available throughout the application.
2. Metrics can be imported through the Metric import flow on the metrics page.
